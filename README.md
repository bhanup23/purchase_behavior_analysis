# ðŸ§® Applied Probability & Statistics on E-Commerce Data

This project demonstrates how to apply core concepts of **Applied Probability and Statistics** to analyze customer behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modeling and regression.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Clean and preprocess e-commerce transaction data
- Perform EDA on RFM metrics
- Fit probability distributions (Normal) to monetary data
- Conduct hypothesis testing (T-tests) on spending behavior
- Calculate confidence intervals for mean monetary value
- Predict spending using regression based on Recency and Frequency

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

You can run the project locally using:
